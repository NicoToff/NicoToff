# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m `NicoToff`
I'm a former translator and I'm transpiling my brain into software and web development.
You can also find me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/NicolasToffolo)

## What I can do
I can cook, but you don't care, so see below...

I'm not updating this file very regularly, so instead, [check out my portfolio website to know more](https://nicotoff.vercel.app).
